    <h1>Studying Microinteractions on Genius</h1>

            <h2>The Overview</h2>
                <p>Genius is a popular website used to search up the lyrics for all kinds of songs. From K-pop to R&amp;B, Genius allows people from all over the world to see the lyrics to their favorite songs. Using CSS and Javascript, the goal of this project was to add microinterations to parts of the Genius website as a way to improve their user experience. Specifically, the changes were focused on the interactions with the lyrics page and lyric annotations.</p>
            <h2>Context and Challenge</h2>
                <p>The original Genius website lacked animations and signifiers for most of their interactions. The only aspects that had any sort of indicators were the highlighted lyrics, the copy link button, and the share to social media button. Other than those interactions, all the other clickable elements just had a cursor change while hovering over them. I wanted to make it so using the website was less jaring for users. Given the time restraints, I focused on improving 5 different elements:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Highlighted Text</li>
                    <li>Contributor Label</li>
                    <li>Like Button</li>
                    <li>Share Button</li>
                    <li>Copy Link Button</li>
                </ol>
            <h2>Process and Insights</h2>
                <h3>Planning</h3>
                    <p>First, I planned out what I wanted from certain aspects on the page. I took screenshots of the page and edited them to fit my vision for what I wanted to happen in place of the sudden changes that Genius originally had. I kept the already existing microinterations and added improvements through animation. For elements that had no microinteractions, I added visual indicators of their statuses for improved user experience.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, written descriptions of the interactions were created for each element. These descriptions describe the elements' triggers and actions that happens when the triggers occur. This allowed for a more details of how each interaction would play out that still images could not convey.</p>

                <h3>Building</h3>
                    <p>First, each element was created with HTML. Before adding any animations, I had to make sure each element looked the way it should and were labeled accordingly for use in other code. Afterwards, I added color and styled the page so that the elements matched the original Genius website. Using CSS, I also added animations to elements that didn't require additional actions. This includes elements that had hover states, such as the highlighted text and the contributor label.</p>
